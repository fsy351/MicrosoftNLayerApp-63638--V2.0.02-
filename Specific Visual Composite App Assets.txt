
In case we have a Visual Composite App (like when using PRISM), here we would have the specifics visual assets 
for this BOUNDED-CONTEXT.
Our example, even when we support a structure for having several BOUNDED-CONTEXTS with a related MODEL per each,
for simplicity we are not using any Visual Composite App framework. 
Therefore, we only have a single Presentation Layer (Client) for all the possible BCs.
